# Understanding Power
## Power Structure
Traditional form of power was hierarchical, while the shifting form of power is network-based. This is because the barriers for communication have lowered and anyone is capable of building a network that gives them leverage in today's economy. 
## Power is Slippery
Power is easier to gain, easier to lose, but harder to use. Small groups of people are disrupting industries. The guards that use to protect the established power players are weaker.  
## Power is Revealing
Power doesn't corrupt, rather it reveals the true character of the person. People hide their true character when they don't have power because of the consequences and let it loose when they gain authority. 
## Givers vs Takers
Giver mindset is "what I can do for you". Taker mindset is "what can you do for me".  Both can be motivated for power, but both have different reasons for wanting it. Takers want to use power for personal gain. Givers want to use power to help others and serve the greater good. Givers tend to achieve more over the arc of their careers in comparison to takers.  Givers become long lasting leaders because of their reputation, value, and respect amongst their peers, while takers are resented in the long-run.
## Powerful vs Others
The powerful become transparent to everyone around them, and the ones around them with less power become "hidden" to them. This makes judging character difficult for the ones in power. 
Hiring is one of my important role powerful people play. Here're some hiring tips:
* Ask every applicant the same question. By doing so, it is possible to compare the answers of all the applicants and single out the best ones. Compare apples with apples.
* Ask situational questions in additional to behavioral ones. Behavioral questions are based on their past circumstances, which gives advantage to applicants with more experience and natural talkers. Situational questions are ones based on a hypothetical situation for the role they're applying for. These kind give insights onto how they will deal with problems in the actual role they will be hired for. 
* Create a scoring key to quantify strong answers from weak answers by testing it on strong vs weak performers in your company
* Use the perspective of 4 different interviewers before making the final decision

# Teamwork 
## Guidance vs Control
Leadership should consider balancing between giving guidance and giving control to their team. They need enough guidance to achieve the organization's goal and enough control to feel engaged and empowered in their roles to perform at their peak. Employees who are engaged bring novel, innovative ideas. They typically have a great intuition of the chances of company's success on initiatives because they are in the frontlines and are closer to the problem, and hence the solution. This fact doesn't discount the executive's contribution of guiding the team based on a broader perspective, but suggests that everyone's with merit should be heard.
## We are Humans
As leaders, showing vulnerability, that is authentic and genuine, is powerful for building trust and buy in from subordinates. Maintaining an image of perfection and error-free is intimidating for employees. This leads to employees disengagement from the team and the company. 
## Not I or You, but We
Leaders shouldn't just delegate tasks and dust their hands and walk away. They should act and talk as collaborators with their teams. This is accomplished by digging into some of the lower level work themselves and speaking of achieving objectives using "We" instead of "You" or "I". 
## Flavors of Power
* Coercive (threats and punishments)
* Reward power (offer incentives)
* Legitimate power (title and position)
* Referent power (liked and admired)
* Expert power (knowledge and skills)
* Informational power (data and network) - NEW in the digital economy
* Power tips:
    * Expand the scope of employee's responsibility
    * Involve employees in the decisions that affect them
    * Show employees that their work matters

# Changing Company Culture
## Connectedness 
The world is connected and the average person have more power because they have more options, information, and capability to change. This makes employee retention harder for companies who cannot support a healthy, constructive culture, and where work is not meaningful and motivating.
## No Means No
Hard boundaries are necessary for establishing or changing the current culture. Think "You must have 2 weeks of vacation", instead of "unlimited vacation" where no one takes any vacation to avoid being seen as a slacker. These guiding principles act as a consensus amongst the company, that help empower all their employees. True culture change happens from both top-down and bottom-up. 
## Job Crafting
An exercise where the employers asks employees to give feedback about their jobs in an effort to build an ideal job. A study done at Goldman Sachs found that analysts wanted their jobs to include more problem solving, learning, and time with clients to see the outcomes of their work.
## Organizational Uniqueness Bias 
Gauge the culture of company by asking their employees about a story that's unique to their company. Collect enough stories and you will see a pattern of the company culture. Everyone may think that the stories are unique to their company, but culture stories are answers to universal questions. Is my boss human? Will I get fired for doing X? Is this a fair and just environment? What will it take for me to be successful? Do I have any control? The answers to these questions define the collective belief of employees, and hence, the overall company culture.
## Walk the Talk
A difference between values that are said and acted out leads to a incongruent culture. Company culture is what people do when no one is watching them. Changing culture, for the better, is about closing the gap between the voiced out values and the acted out values. It has be fixed one leader and employee at a time and lead by examples.
## Power tips:
* Lead with all the bad things that will happen if the company doesn't change the culture. People are motivated for preventing losses, rather than attainment of gains. It's a framing problem. 
* Fixed mindset people are an obstacle to change. Ask them to reflect on changes they made in their own lives for the better.

# Technology and the Future of Jobs
## Can't Explain It, Don’t Trust It
If we don't have visibility on how machines make decisions, we risk empowering the wrong group, people or idea. As end-user of intelligent machines, we have no way to protest or question the black boxes that make decisions based on a hidden or unexplainable algorithm. When it comes to important decision, making an algorithm that is explainable is key for accountability and trust. 
## More jobs, Not less
Automation is creating more jobs, not fewer, but the newer jobs demand more technical competence. This competence will be need to work with complex machines effectively. Automation is also critical for the future because the shrinking working class needs leverage from machines to be more productive, so that they can support the growing dependent population. Half of growing jobs are in science and technology, specifically analytical fields with complex analysis. The other half of other growing jobs are in care and service, which require emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is where humans shine over machines. 
## Emotional Intelligence
* Emotional intelligence is an important skill for care, service, leadership, and management. Value of this skill will continue to rise over time. Three skills are needed:
    * Identifying emotion in yourself, others and things
    * Understanding the role of emotions
    * Managing emotions over yourself and others
	
# Being Listened, Not Heard
## Skeptics of the Big Man
There is a general loss of trust amongst institutions, government, and corporations. These entities and professionals face the biggest challenges is getting others to adopt their priorities and mission. This is because of the shift towards a decentralized, network-based economy rather than a top-down, hierarchical one. Many respected professional, like scientists, find they need to advocate for their work to have any chance of success, influence and/or impact. Doing good work isn't enough anymore, one need to be able to tell a story behind it. Fact on their own mean very little and don't scale.
## Story Telling is Cool
How we deliver the message and the source of the message is just as important of the message. Learn how to talk in images. Take a picture and describe it. The general audience are better influence by the concrete over the abstract.
## Outsourcing Inspiration
People who are closest to the problem are also closest to the solution. So, bringing in an impacted end-user to share their experiences is immensely important to get buy in from all stakeholders and the community. Things don’t take off at scale unless they are embraced by all the stakeholders. Also, the team work harder when we know it helps others directly and can see it. 

# Personal Remarks
Here are my main takeaways from this book are:
* to strengthen my "Giver" mindset ("What can I do for you? What do you value and how can I use my skills to provide it?")
* routinely think how machine learning will replace parts of my job and actively grow new relevant skills to counter it
* ask better, revealing questions for judging company cultures
