This is my personal summary of the book, _Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win_, by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin.

## Personal
### Extreme Ownership
A leader must focus solely on what they can control and take responsibility for rather 
than blame others and make excuses. Because the team members look up to the leader as a role 
model, the leader's attitude permeates the team. Therefore, the leader must demonstrate that 
they takes extreme ownership to make the mission a success, which will cause their team members to follow suit. 

### Only Bad Leaders
A leaders make or break the team. A great leader with ineffective team members can easily outshine a bad 
leader with all star team members. The leader sets the tone and the mini-culture to how the team sees 
themselves and the problems they tackle. They also influence what the team pays attention to.

### The Why
The team must understand the why and it's importance, or else they will not put their 100% into the mission. 
The leader must make the mission personal to each of their team members, so that they care about its success.
 
### Ego is the Enemy
The leader must admit when they don’t know something or they are wrong about a decision, and focus on learning 
from their circumstances. They must appropriately balance their need for personal gains and recognition with 
achieving the mission for the team and company.
 
## The Laws of Combat
### Cover and Move
Cover other teams while they move, move yourself while they cover - every team is on the same mission and they need to help 
each other to help the organization win. When the organization wins, all the teams do as well. Teamwork between 
groups and departments is key to organization's success.
 
### Simple
Avoid unnecessary complexity as it makes communicating the intent difficult up and down the chain of command. 
Simple plans are more likely to be followed as a whole by entire the team harmoniously rather than be 
misinterpreted. Every team member must know the commander's intent, so they have the flexibility to 
implement strategies specific to their roles to accomplish the overall mission. 

### Prioritize and Execute
When the pressure is high and there are endless options, the leader and the team must quickly decide on 
the most important task in regards to the overall mission and put all their energy into executing a solution. 
Rinse and repeat with the next highest prioritized task. This method avoids decision fatigue that results 
from considering too many decisions in a short time, and it keeps the plan simple.

### Decentralized Command
Leaders have a limit to how many people they can lead or manage effectively, which is typically around 4-8. Beyond that, the leaders must delegate their responsibilities to their team and trust they team members have the specialization to do the delegated task effectively. The leader's responsibility is to communicate effectively their intent and the importance of the task by explaining the big picture. The team members must be able to accomplish their tasks in ways that align with their expertise, creativity, and style, while keeping the leader's intent in mind. This way the leader have a greater chance of success with the overall mission. The team members should state what they intend to do, rather than rely on the leader to make every choice for them. 

## Other Concepts
### The Game Plan
A leader must have detailed plan that is comprehensible by their team and their managers. Their communication of the plan should convey the key objectives and their intent to their team, so that they can action on it with priority and decentralized command. 

### Up and Down the Chain of Command
When the upper chain of command isn’t doing what the leader wants or expects, it's the leaders responsibility to provide compelling briefings in order to convince them. That's extreme ownership. Sometimes the leader must lead their leaders for the success of the mission.
 
### Being Decisive amid Uncertainty
A leader must be able to make key decisions in difficult and unclear situations within a reasonable time frame. Too much doubt and hesitation can risk not accomplishing the objectives, and can damage their reputation as a capable leader amongst their team members.
