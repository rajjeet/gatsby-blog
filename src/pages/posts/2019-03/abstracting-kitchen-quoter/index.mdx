## Update
So, I finished building most of the features of the original kitchen quoter a while back. I wasn't satisfied that it was specific 
to one business and client.
In an effort to make a successful side project with real tangible value, I decided to generalize it. 
My goal is allow any user, who needs to generate quotes interactively, to build their own calculators on the fly.
Here's my progress so far...

## BYOC - Build Your Own Calculator
Building a calculator for generating quotes involves three steps.
### 1. Specifying the calculator fields
Using a form, a user would create entries for each of the calculator fields and specify its 
constraints and properties. This includes details like name, label, type, maximums, minimums, default value,
and options.

Let's use an example of a business that needs to build  boxes for their customers. 
In order to accurately price their customers, the business owners need to know the height, width, length, material
, thickness and extra add-ons (like hinges). For each of these factors, the user would create a calculator
field and specify its properties. For example, height is a number between 0 ft and 100 ft with a default of 1 ft.

### 2. Writing the algorithm
Once the key input fields and their details are captured, the calculator needs to know
how to combine them to generate a quote or dollar value. This step would includes writing an 
algorithm that dictates how the fields are mathematically related to one another, in regards to price.

For example, the box building business decides to price their customers based on adding the material cost,
labour, and a certain profit margin. Here's an hypothetical equation:
```javascript
price = (length * width * height * material * thickness + accessories + labour_cost) 
    * profit_margin  
```
The user would write this equation into the formula section to validate and save it. 

### 3. Generating Quotes
Once step 1 and 2 are finished, the user can start using the custom calculator on the home page for generating quotes using an interactive 
form. This is similar to the form I built for <a target="_blank" href="//ortmesh.com/kitchen-quoter">Landmark Kitchens.</a>
The quotation will update dynamically when the user changes any aspect of the form. 

## Next Steps
My next major step is to connect the two different mini-apps I've built so far, the Kitchen Quoter and this custom
calculator tool. Once this is finished, it will be ready for use by anyone.
