### Ultralearning
Currently, I'm listening to [Ultralearning](https://www.amazon.ca/Ultralearning-Master-Outsmart-Competition-Accelerate/dp/1982662964) on Audible. This book is reemphasizing the importance for self-directed learning that's focused on building hard skills that deliver results. **Side projects** with hard deadlines and demanding deliverables is that type of learning.
 
 I'm intending to use concepts from this book to drive a new approach towards working on side projects. My current side project is my blog site, [Ortmesh](ortmesh.com), which has a hard, self-imposed deadline of today!. It's time for a new project now.

 Before moving on, I'm reflecting on my experiences with past side projects and contrasting it with the book. I'm discovering that my side projects need structure and purpose. Knowing the what, why and how upfront (aka. Drawing a map) is the first step of ultralearning.

### Drawing a Map

#### The Why 
 **Each side project you work on helps build a set of skills.** The skills can help you create better work, and give you greater control over your career trajectory. These skills aren't easy to work on. They require intense focus, backed up with deliberate process for self-improvement. It's not about doing what's easy, but the growth that comes from overcoming obstacles.   
 
Best tip I read about _side projects_ is Warren Buffet's [10/10/10 Rule](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-warren-buffetts-10-10-10-rule-will-help-you-make-smarter-decisions-43d63d5ea124). The benefits of each project should be recognized whether it's 10 minutes, days, months, or years. This helps keep the project worthwhile in the face of setbacks, boredom, and priority conflicts.  
 
 Other than building specific skills from each project, working through multiple projects improves **metalearning**. Metalearning, in loose terms, is to **learn how to learn** a specific set of skills in an area of expertise. This is what enables people to learn 10 different languages. With each language learned, these polygots pick up the subtle mechanics of learning languages and carrying their expertise forward with newer languages. They learn faster. 
 
 My own goal be that "polygot" version of a software engineer. It's not about learning many software languages and technologies. Rather, **it's about using a cadence of side projects to train myself to solve software-related challenges.**

#### The What 
Over the 2 weeks of vacation, I will be thinking a list of side projects to work on over the next year. To really push myself, I'm going to complete **6 side projects in 12 months**. Here's the list I've come up with so far:

1. public facing API with a subscription model
2. launch a documentation website on a niche, relevant, and poorly-documented topic
3. build an e-commerce website that sells a very niche product
4. develop a mobile app
5. author a npm software package (aka. software library for other developers)
6. religiously contribute to an open source project (i.e. Gatsby or NextJS)

Each of these potential side projects will push me to learn new concepts in order to deliver the results by the deadline. The deadline for my next project will be December 15th, 2019. 

#### The How
_30 hours/week on the side project and 5 hours/week for posting articles._  I really want to spend more than 30 hours/week but finding time is not easy.

Also, I will keep a Kanban board for each project, like I did for my blog. Thanks to a tip by [John Sonmez](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/john-sonmez?aid=701j0000001heIqAAI), my productivity skyrocketed after using [KanbanFlow](https://kanbanflow.com/features).

### Concluding Remarks
Seeing the progress span over a year will be an interesting project in itself. I've set an ambitious goal for myself and I'm confident that my readers will learn from my experiences. I'm also looking forward to documenting the process and progressively seeing how my metalearning improves over time. If you would like collaborate on projects with me, shoot me a message. In my future posts, I want to expand on the _the what_ and _the how_ parts of this article.
