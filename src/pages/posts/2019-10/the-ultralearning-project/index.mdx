### Damage control
Why my wife will _hate_ me for writing this article? Because I'm going to spend way too much time writing code than usual. At least, I'm on vacation to Turkey and Dubai tonight for our 2nd wedding anniversary.

### The Situation
Currently, I'm listening to [Ultralearning](https://www.amazon.ca/Ultralearning-Master-Outsmart-Competition-Accelerate/dp/1982662964) on Audible. This book is reemphasizing the importance for self-directed learning that's focused on building hard skills that deliver results. **Side projects** with hard deadlines and demanding deliverables are the key. 

The hard deadline for my blog website, [Ortmesh](ortmesh.com), is today! Well, it was technically October 15th, but I'm on vacation so my time is up. Now, it's time for a new challenge!   

I'm writing this post the following reasons:

1. Public commitments are a great way to pressure yourself 
2. Builds context for my future posts 
3. Interested in writing series of self-documenting posts on my thoughts and the process 

### Ultralearning - Step 1: Draw a Map
#### The Why 
 The goal of the side projects are to build skills that will further my career in software development. Getting a diverse set of very specialized skills isn't practical or demanding enough in any typical day job or school setting. They need to be intentionally sought out, practiced and applied to real world problems. Mastery is an amazing reward in itself.
 
 Besides the acquired skills, the side projects should provide real value as well. I want to adhere to Warren Buffet's [10/10/10 Rule](https://medium.com/the-mission/why-warren-buffetts-10-10-10-rule-will-help-you-make-smarter-decisions-43d63d5ea124), and build stuff that has potential now and in the future. This helps keep the project worthwhile in the face of setbacks, boredom, and priority conflicts.
 
As mentioned in the Ultralearning book, working through multiple projects improves **metalearning**. **This is learning how to learn anything and solve any problem in the best way possible**. This is perhaps the greatest outcome of this exercise. 

#### The What 
To really push myself, I'm going to complete **6 side projects in 12 months**. Over the next week, I will pick from the following list:

1. public facing GraphQL API with a possible subscription model
2. launch a documentation website on a niche, relevant, and poorly-documented topic
3. build an e-commerce website that sells a niche product  
4. develop a React Native mobile app that has parity with the web app in #3
5. author a npm package and possibility promote it via documentation website
6. heavily contribute to an open source project I love (i.e. Gatsby)

The main issue will be to pick a specific problem to solve. That requires a bit of research and thought.

#### The How
20 hours/week on the side project and 5 hours/week for posting articles. I keep track. I really want to spend more than 20 hours/week but finding time is not easy. That's why I manage my time ruthlessly in the first place. I'm always looking for ways to increase this benchmark every week.

Also, I will keep a Kanban board for each project, like I did for my blog. Thanks to a tip by [John Sonmez](https://app.pluralsight.com/profile/author/john-sonmez?aid=701j0000001heIqAAI), my productivity skyrocketed after using [KanbanFlow](https://kanbanflow.com/features). I use the timers to gauge my estimates vs actual time spend on tasks.

### Concluding Remarks
I write these articles because I want to find intense workaholics like myself to collaborate with. Ask any entrepreneur what their hardest challenge is and most likely it's **finding the RIGHT people to work with**. My goal with these projects is to advance myself to new heights, and find others on a similar path for potential partnerships.
